Glue together tables with foreign keys

Implementing relationships with foreign keys
FK points to the PK of another table
Domain of FK must be equal to domain of PK
Each value of FK must exist in PK of other table (FK constraint or referential integrity)
FK are not actualy keys, dupes and null are allowed

When you create a new table you can specify a FK similar to how we specify a PK

/*
REFERENCE a table with a FOREIGN KEY
In your database, you want the professors table to reference the universities table. You can do that by specifying a column in professors table that references a column in the universities table.

As just shown in the video, the syntax for that looks like this:

ALTER TABLE a 
ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES b (id);
Table a should now refer to table b, via b_id, which points to id. a_fkey is, as usual, a constraint name you can choose on your own.

Pay attention to the naming convention employed here: Usually, a foreign key referencing another primary key with name id is named x_id, where x is the name of the referencing table in the singular form.
*/
/*
Rename the university_shortname column to university_id in professors.
*/
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
 RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;
 /*
 Add a foreign key on university_id column in professors that references the id column in universities.
Name this foreign key professors_fkey.
*/
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);

/*
Explore foreign key constraints
Foreign key constraints help you to keep order in your database mini-world. In your database, for instance, only professors belonging to Swiss universities should be allowed, as only Swiss universities are part of the universities table.

The foreign key on professors referencing universities you just created thus makes sure that only existing universities can be specified when inserting new data. Let's test this!
*/
/*
Run the sample code and have a look at the error message.
What's wrong? Correct the university_id so that it actually reflects where Albert Einstein wrote his dissertation and became a professor – at the University of Zurich (UZH)!
*/
-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
VALUES ('Albert', 'Einstein', 'UZH');
/*
JOIN tables linked by a foreign key
Let's join these two tables to analyze the data further!

You might already know how SQL joins work from the Intro to SQL for Data Science course (last exercise) or from Joining Data in PostgreSQL.

Here's a quick recap on how joins generally work:

SELECT ...
FROM table_a
JOIN table_b
ON ...
WHERE ...
While foreign keys and primary keys are not strictly necessary for join queries, they greatly help by telling you what to expect. For instance, you can be sure that records referenced from table A will always be present in table B – so a join from table A will always find something in table B. If not, the foreign key constraint would be violated.
*/
/*
JOIN professors with universities on professors.university_id = universities.id, i.e., retain all records where the foreign key of professors is equal to the primary key of universities.
Filter for university_city = 'Zurich'.
*/
-- Select all professors working for universities in the city of Zurich
SELECT professors.lastname, universities.id, universities.university_city
FROM professors
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
WHERE universities.university_city = 'Zurich';

Model more complex relationships

N:M Relationships
- Create a table
- Add foreign keys for every connected table
- Add additional attributes
- No primary key, as it is possible to have multiple
/*

Add foreign keys to the "affiliations" table
At the moment, the affiliations table has the structure {firstname, lastname, function, organization}, as you can see in the preview at the bottom right. In the next three exercises, you're going to turn this table into the form {professor_id, organization_id, function}, with professor_id and organization_id being foreign keys that point to the respective tables.

You're going to transform the affiliations table in-place, i.e., without creating a temporary table to cache your intermediate results.

/*

/*
Populate the "professor_id" column
Now it's time to also populate professors_id. You'll take the ID directly from professors.

Here's a way to update columns of a table based on values in another table:

UPDATE table_a
SET column_to_update = table_b.column_to_update_from
FROM table_b
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND ...;
This query does the following:

For each row in table_a, find the corresponding row in table_b where condition1, condition2, etc., are met.
Set the value of column_to_update to the value of column_to_update_from (from that corresponding row).
The conditions usually compare other columns of both tables, e.g. table_a.some_column = table_b.some_column. Of course, this query only makes sense if there is only one matching row in table_b.
*/
/*
First, have a look at the current state of affiliations by fetching 10 rows and all columns.
*/
-- Have a look at the 10 first rows of affiliations
SELECT * FROM affiliations
LIMIT 10;
/*
Update the professor_id column with the corresponding value of the id column in professors.
"Corresponding" means rows in professors where the firstname and lastname are identical to the ones in affiliations.
*/
-- Set professor_id to professors.id where firstname, lastname correspond to rows in professors
UPDATE affiliations
SET professor_id = professors.id
FROM professors
WHERE affiliations.firstname = professors.firstname AND affiliations.lastname = professors.lastname;

Check out the first 10 rows and all columns of affiliations again. Have the professor_ids been correctly matched?

SELECT * FROM affiliations
LIMIT 10;

/*
Drop "firstname" and "lastname"
The firstname and lastname columns of affiliations were used to establish a link to the professors table in the last exercise – so the appropriate professor IDs could be copied over. This only worked because there is exactly one corresponding professor for each row in affiliations. In other words: {firstname, lastname} is a candidate key of professors – a unique combination of columns.

It isn't one in affiliations though, because, as said in the video, professors can have more than one affiliation.

Because professors are referenced by professor_id now, the firstname and lastname columns are no longer needed, so it's time to drop them. After all, one of the goals of a database is to reduce redundancy where possible.

/*
Drop the firstname and lastname columns from the affiliations table.

-- Drop the firstname column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP COLUMN firstname;

/*
Referential Integrity
- A record referencing another table must refer to an existing record in that table.
- Specified between two tables
- Enforced through foreign keys

Referential Integrity Violations
Referential integrity from table A to table B is violated… (A has a foreign key that references from B)

- …if a record in table B that is referenced from a record in table A is deleted.
- …if a record in table A referencing a non-existing record from table B is inserted.
- Foreign keys prevent violations!

Dealing with violations
ON DELETE…

…NO ACTION: Throw an error

CREATE TABLE a (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
column_a varchar(64), 
...,
b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION
);
-- will throw an error if violation happens
…CASCADE: Delete all referencing records

CREATE TABLE a (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
column_a varchar(64), 
...,
b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
-- cascade the deletion
…RESTRICT: Throw an error

…SET NULL: Set the referencing column to NULL
…SET DEFAULT: Set the referencing column to its default value
*/

/*
Referential integrity violations
Given the current state of your database, what happens if you execute the following SQL statement?

DELETE FROM universities WHERE id = 'EPF';
*/
It fails because referential integrity from professors to universities is violated.

/*
Change the referential integrity behavior of a key
So far, you implemented three foreign key constraints:

professors.university_id to universities.id
affiliations.organization_id to organizations.id
affiliations.professor_id to professors.id
These foreign keys currently have the behavior ON DELETE NO ACTION. Here, you're going to change that behavior for the column referencing organizations from affiliations. If an organization is deleted, all its affiliations (by any professor) should also be deleted.

Altering a key constraint doesn't work with ALTER COLUMN. Instead, you have to delete the key constraint and then add a new one with a different ON DELETE behavior.

For deleting constraints, though, you need to know their name. This information is also stored in information_schema.

ROUNDUP


Count affiliations per university
Now that your data is ready for analysis, let's run some exemplary SQL queries on the database. You'll now use already known concepts such as grouping by columns and joining tables.

In this exercise, you will find out which university has the most affiliations (through its professors). For that, you need both affiliations and professors tables, as the latter also holds the university_id.

As a quick repetition, remember that joins have the following structure:

SELECT table_a.column1, table_a.column2, table_b.column1, ... 
FROM table_a
JOIN table_b 
ON table_a.column = table_b.column
This results in a combination of table_a and table_b, but only with rows where table_a.column is equal to table_b.column.

/*
Count the number of total affiliations by university.
Sort the result by that count, in descending order.

GROUP BY professors.university_id

/*
Join all the tables together
In this last exercise, you will find the university city of the professor with the most affiliations in the sector "Media & communication".

For this, you need to join all the tables, group by a column, and then use selection criteria to get only the rows in the correct sector.
